# Corona-DOOM

Flutter Hack20 Submission

## What about the app

This app, or more of a game, is a DOOM-like game in which monsters resembles coronavirus. The game is using AR, so player can interract with their surrounding while busting up the viruses. At this initial version, the viruses will only appear within 180 degrees in front of player (left to right).

## How to install

Prerequisites:

- Real android device (I don't think emulator will work) that supports AR Core
- Flutter installation
- IDE of your choice (optional)

Once you fulfill the prerequisites, you can just install using flutter debug / flutter run.
